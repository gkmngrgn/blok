# BLOK

A simple Blockchain implementation written in Python. I took advantage of [this source](https://www.gauravvjn.com/building-a-simple-blockchain-in-python-part-2/).


## Installation

After you installed [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), just type `poetry install`.

To run unit tests:

```shell
$ poetry run pytest
```
